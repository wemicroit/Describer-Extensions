<h1>Contributions</h1>
<h2>Existing issue</h2>
<p>I welcome others to contribute towards these extensions by assigning an Issue to them selves, creating a branch from Develop named according the following documented conventions:</p>
<p>Once an issue is believed to have been resolved a Pull request needs to be made to merge the branch back into the appropiate release branch</p>
<p>An administrator will review the code and if happy merge it into the release branch.</p>
<p>Please note any new functionality which is implemented needs to be unit tested as well as documented using the conventions in place</p>
<hr />
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>Please raise an issue for each bug you uncover, so that a developer can address it and follow the above procedure.</p>
<p>Where practical all bug fixes should include atleast 1 if not more unit tests which will catch this bug from occuring again.
<hr />
<h2>New Features</h2>
<p>Prior to working any new feature please create an issue for it and once it has been approved aka assigned to a MileStone, you can start working on it</p>
<p>We will in most scenarios approve any new features, however there can be scenarios where we will opt to start a new project/repo which references this one to avoid this project growing signifigantly in scope.</p>
<p>This is why we recomend you not starting on any new features untill they have been approved by an admin.</p>
